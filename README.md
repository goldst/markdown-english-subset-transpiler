# Markdown English Subset Transpiler
This small script takes markdown files that contain specific types of English sentences and converts them to JavaScript.

I did this this project in one day and currently don't plan to continue it. Don't expect anything to work. If you really really want to try it anyway, run

```
node compile.js Default_Definitions.md > out.js
```
and then
```
node out.js [args]
```
